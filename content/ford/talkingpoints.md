description: "Unfunded 10% Tuition Fee Reduction will result in an approximate 4% cut to university budgets. Universities will be under pressure to outsource, cut services, increase precarious employment, and/or lay-off staff. Regressive OSAP changes will result in massive increased student debt and increased burden for mature students. Elimination of Rand Formula-style funding for student unions. Optional student union dues, ancillary fees, and democratic levies could bankrupt."

## Overview

-   Students and workers are appalled by the Doug Ford government’s
    shameful attempt to use a tuition fee reduction as a political
    gimmick to try and hide a $600 million cut to student grants, a $440
    million cut to university and college budgets, all and a petty and
    vindictive attack on democratic students’ unions.

-   Ontario’s faculty, staff, and students are united in our opposition
    to these cuts and attacks, which threaten education quality,
    accessibility, and student life on campus.

## Tuition fee reductions

-   We are in favour of making postsecondary education more accessible
    and has long advocated for tuition fee reductions, but not in the
    absence of increased core funding and sound student financial
    aid policy.

-   Without increased public funding for Ontario’s universities and
    colleges, the Ford Government’s announced tuition fee reduction is
    nothing more than a $440 million cut to the province’s already
    under-funded universities and colleges. This cut follows a decade of
    eroding funding for postsecondary education in Ontario

-   Despite these reductions, most students will find themselves deeper
    in debt.

-   It is important to note that Minister Fullerton signaled the
    government’s commitment to not cut core operating grants for
    postsecondary institutions, but these ill-conceived tuition fee
    reductions will shrink university budgets, increase class sizes,
    encourage further tuition fee hikes for international students, and
    threaten both the accessibility and quality of postsecondary
    education in Ontario.

-   International students, who pay the highest tuition fees in Ontario
    ($34,961 per year on average at the undergraduate level), are
    ineligible for this 10 per cent reduction in tuition fees.

## OSAP cuts

-   The announced OSAP cuts and changes to eligibility criteria mean it
    will be harder for many students to access postsecondary education.
    The $600 million cut to student grants will result in thousands of
    students being forced to take out expensive loans and graduate with
    even more debt.

-   While the government may try to use the misleading and inaccurate
    Auditor General’s report for political cover, there is no good
    argument to be made for rolling back OSAP. Given the data available,
    it was an effective and popular program desperately needed by
    Ontario students.

-   We have real concerns with the Auditor General’s Report. It’s clear
    that most of the money in the existing program was reallocated from
    less effective financial assistance programs. The Auditor General’s
    claim that it is unsustainable is misleading.

-   Like a lot of Ford’s spin, this is a manufactured crisis being used
    to attack Ontario’s most vulnerable. This is a regressive policy
    that will force students from low-income families to pay more for
    their education.

## Attacks on students

### Ancillary fees


-   Ancillary fees are those fees that "support services and activities
    distinct from academic programming or general overhead for
    the institution. Examples of ancillary fees include convocation
    fees, student activity fees, athletic fees, health care and
    insurance fees, field trip fees and fees associated with the cost of
    buildings such as student centres.” Also, certain technology fees.

-   It is how the fee is set that matters, not what it pays for. When
    students vote to create a fee to fund a service through a referenda,
    they are expressing their democratic will. Any attempt by the
    government or institution to make these fee voluntary is an attack
    on democracy and students' rights.

-   These fees can be implemented in a few different ways, but it is
    important to distinguish between those fees that are set by a
    university or college administration and those fees that are set by
    students in democratic referenda.


### Student Dues

-   Students’ unions are distinct and independent
    democratic organizations. Students’ unions are formed and their dues
    are set by democratic referenda. Rather than paying for a specific
    non-academic activity or service, students’ union membership dues
    maintain the independent democratically elected and run students’
    unions that represent students on university, college and government
    committees, advocate on behalf students, and provide
    cost-saving services.

-   Students’ unions are democratically run not-for-profits founded by
    and for students and should be free from government interference.

-   The dues that students’ unions collect and how those dues are spent
    are determined by students through annual elections, referenda, and
    membership meetings.

-   Making these dues optional would fundamentally undermine the rights
    of students and their ability to collectively organize and advocate
    as a group. It is a cynical attack on students’ rights that assumes
    that students are not able to make democratic decisions
    for themselves.

-   Through their advocacy work, students’ play an important role
    holding universities and governments accountable for decisions about
    issues including tuition fees and student financial assistance.

-   The government’s unnecessary and anti-democratic decision to make
    many student fees voluntary is not about choice. It is a deliberate
    effort to undermine students’ rights and dismantle democratic
    students’ unions. This is a petty and vindictive government driven
    by a desire to silence opposing voices, especially on university and
    college campuses.

-   It is no coincidence that this government is cutting support for
    students’ unions at the same time they are cutting OSAP and
    university and college budgets.

-   Despite this government’s claim to care about “free speech”, this is
    a deliberate attempt to stifle political debate, dissent, and
    student speech on campus. It will defund the students’ unions and
    student media that work to hold the government to account on
    postsecondary education issues.

-   The average students’ union dues are roughly only $100 and the
    services they provide are essential, including campus food banks,
    women’s centres, pride centres, Indigenous services centres, mental
    health support centres, sexual assault support centres, subsidized
    transit passes, non-profit health and dental plans, academic support
    and advocate services (such as challenging academic misconduct
    decisions and representing students on tribunals), funding for
    campus clubs and societies, funding for student refugees, collecting
    levies for independent campus press, and operating affordable
    non-profit commercial services such as book stores, restaurants
    and cafes.

-   Every student pays dues that support these services, every student
    has access to all of these services, but only those students who
    need support use these services. That is how it should be. Students
    have decided to democratically work together to fund a students’
    union that can represent, advocate, and provide services for the
    collective good of all students.

-   Students’ union provide good jobs for thousands of students
    across Ontario.

-   Making students’ union fees optional will irrevocably harm student
    life on campus and eliminate many of the services students
    depend on.

### Fee Bureaucracy and Democracy

-   Making these fees optional will substantially increase
    costs and red tape for university and college administration as they
    struggle to absorb essential services defunded by this government.

-   At every level of government, elected leaders sometimes do things
    they should not. In response, we don’t abolish or defund the
    government or the democratic structures that support it, we hold our
    elected representatives to account and make sure that, as a society
    or as a union or as a students’ union, we have laws and regulations
    in place to prevent these incidents.

## Consultation

-   It is shocking that the government would make an announcement of
    this magnitude without consulting any stakeholders at the province’s
    postsecondary institutions, including students, faculty, staff, or
    even university and college administrations.

-   In fact, despite the fact that postsecondary stakeholder groups,
    including students, faculty, and staff, have repeatedly requested
    meeting with this Minister of Training, Colleges, and Universities
    Merillee Fullerton, the Minister has chosen to ignore or deny
    those requests.

-   This complete lack of consultation, transparency, and accountability
    demonstrates that Doug Ford’s government does not represent—nor does
    it care for—the interests of the students, faculty, or staff at
    Ontario’s universities and colleges.
