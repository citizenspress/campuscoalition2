What better way to welcome back the government than throwing them a Welcome Back Party with students from across the province? 

Join us for a rally at Queen’s Park filled with entertainment, student and solidarity partner speakers, some cupcakes and petition collection.

## Week of actions

Students across Ontario have made it clear that the Provincial government picked a fight with the wrong people.

We The Students call on the government to:

- Provide More Grants NOT loans
- Eliminate Tuition Fees for ALL Students
- Increase Public Funding for Public Education
- Protect ALL Independent Student Voices, and,
- Defend the Right to Organize

Join us for a Week of Action from Tuesday, February 19 to Friday, February 22 to welcome back Members of Provincial Parliament as they head back to Queen’s Park to remind them that We The Students will NOT accept their cuts to OSAP and their attack on student autonomy!
