description: The Ottawa PSE Coalition invites you and your members to attend our upcoming
  coalition meeting. We are a group of students and community members that are concerned
  about the announced changes to OSAP and post-secondary funding as well as how student
  fees will be collected. We know that these changes will cause uncertain work conditions
  for staff and faculty, less access to education and lower the value of studentsâ€™
  education.
