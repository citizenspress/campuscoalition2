On March 20, 2019 Students of GBC will be walking out of class at 12pm/noon in demonstration of the widespread disapproval of the Ford government cuts to education.   
  
Together we unite and say “NO!” to the government’s planned attack on students. We say NO! to the cuts to funding post-secondary education; to detrimental changes to OSAP; to attempts to cut students off from student services, student life, and student democracy.   
  
12pm/noon – walk-out of class  
12pm/noon – meet in the Kings Lounge, St.James campus, 200 Kings St.E.  
  
Together we will form a “student parade” (aka a mini-march) around the building returning to the Kings Lounge for a FREE breakfast for FREE education.
