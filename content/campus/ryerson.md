## Coalition Meeting Invitation

We Are The Students Ryerson would like to invite you and your members to attend our upcoming coalition meeting. We are a group of students and community members that are concerned about the announced changes to OSAP and post-secondary funding as well as how student fees will be collected. We know that these changes will cause uncertain work conditions for staff and faculty, less access to education and lower the value of students’ education.

For the past week we have been working to mobilize the Ryerson community to respond to these changes through having students sign petitions, attend rallies and be engaged in person and online. 

On Wed. Feb. 13 th from 5PM – 7PM we will be holding a coalition meeting in the Venn (RCC 103). This meeting is for all Ryerson students, staff and faculty that want to be a part of this movement and who want tohave a say in how we move forward.

The evening will be a moderated event where we will briefly talk about what we have done so far, but the majority of it will be giving the community space to brainstorm ideas on what this movement will look like in the coming weeks. We look forward to working with you and your members.

In solidarity,

We Are The Students Ryerson
