WHO'S CAMPUS? OUR CAMPUS!

This past January, the Ontario government announced changes to post-secondary education that will cut OSAP and de-fund our democratically chosen student groups, dramatically affect students and their access to education. Across Ontario, students are gearing up for a Provincial Day of Action with the Canadian Federation of Students! Join your CSA as thousands of students walk out of classes and protest the changes to OSAP and the Student Choice Initiative.

The CSA will be hosting a picket and outreach day in the UC. Gathering at 12 noon in the UC Courtyard, we will picket the student funded and supported University Centre, reclaiming our campus back from the Ontario government!  
This action is in solidarity with the CUPE 1334, CUPE 3913, and CUPE 1281 members on UofG campus!
