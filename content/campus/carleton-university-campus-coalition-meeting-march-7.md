## Coalition Meeting Invitation

We would like to invite you and your members to attend our first coalition meeting at Carleton University. We encourage all those who are concerned and affected by the proposed cuts and changes to OSAP, post-secondary funding and changes to the collection of student fees to attend and take part in furthering our mobilization strategy.

These cuts and changes will result in increased barriers to accessible and affordable education, lower quality education and institutions, attacks on unions and collective organizing, unfair work conditions for staff, faculty and more.

We have been educating and mobilizing at Carleton and in the Ottawa community through outreach and volunteer trainings and are seeking to start regular meetings to strategize future actions and ways to progress within this movement.

Please join us on Thursday March 7th from 6PM-8PM for a coalition meeting being held on the 6th floor of the Carleton University Centre (the Graduate Students' Association). Free food will be provided.

This meeting will be a moderated discussion about the steps we've taken so far to engage those at Carleton and Ottawa in this movement. The primary goal of this meeting will be to create a space for stakeholders to brainstorm how we can collectively expand and improve our mobilization and action strategies. We look forward to seeing you and your members there!

In Solidarity,

We The Students Carleton
