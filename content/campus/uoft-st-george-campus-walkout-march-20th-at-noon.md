Over the last several weeks, we have been calling upon U of T administration to take a bold stance and stand with us as we advocate against the reckless changes to post-secondary education that will negatively impact students across the province.

 If you havenâ€™t already signed onto the petition calling on the University to say no to implementing the Student Choice Initiative, sign here: [http://bit.ly/2H0HG6S](http://bit.ly/2H0HG6S "http://bit.ly/2H0HG6S")  
  
We are working to ensure as many students can participate as possible without threat of penalty. We will be posting updates as quickly as we receive them.
