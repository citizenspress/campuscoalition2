Students and workers are appalled by the Doug Ford government’s shameful attempt to use a tuition fee reduction as a political gimmick to try and hide a $600 million cut to student grants, a $440 million cut to university and college budgets, all and a petty and vindictive attack on democratic students’ unions. 

Scroll down or use the menu links to get resources for getting involved.
 
### How to get involved to fight the cuts

1. Sign the petition and send letters to the government. [The CFS-Ontario online action is here.](http://cfsontario.ca/action/).
2. Share that you signed the petition (and the link) with your friends and family. Follow-up with your friends and family to sign the petition as well. Use the hashtag: [#wearethestudents](https://twitter.com/hashtag/WeAreTheStudents?src=hash) and #onpse.
3. Sign-up for email updates.
4. Join the conference calls in your area on organizing actions on campus.
5. Join local actions organized by your student union, worker union, or faculty association to defend Ontario post-secondary education.
6. Start your own actions:
    - Put up posters.
    - Hand-out flyers.
    - Set-up meetings in your department and invite your colleges and/or fellow students to understand how these cuts will affect them.
7. Report [what you are doing to the CFS-Ontario](http://cfsontario.ca/about/contact/) so they can get the word out about your actions and link you with ongoing organizing efforts.
