SUMMARY:Trent University Walkout
URL:https%3A%2F%2Fcampuscoalition.org%2Fcampus%2Ftrent-march20%2F
DESCRIPTION:Peterborough Coalition Against Cuts to Education is organizing a walkout on March 20 at noon in solidarity with students across Ontario. In solidarity with students\, campus unions TUFA and CUPE will be supportive of students leaving class for this event. Please chat with your professor or TA if you have any concerns about leaving class\, and do not feel obligated to leave if you feel your academics or student status are at risk. If you are not leaving class\, please meet students on Bata Podium at noon. We will have a short "pop-up" rally on Bata Podium and then students may return to class or do other things.
